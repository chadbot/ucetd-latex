UCETD LaTeX Class & Template
============================

This repository includes a LaTeX class and template for
correctly formatted electronic Ph.D. dissertations at the University of Chicago.

The [official format specification][spec] can be tough to meet from scratch.
That's why we are providing this class and template. The class, when properly
used as in the template, will make sure your dissertation meets the spec.

This version provides minor modifications, including single-spaced block quotes, and more flexible citations and bibliography formatting. 

The original author of this repo no longer works at the university, and does not support or maintain this package.
